# Description

I could not finish the assignment, I ran into error after error,
and i cannot figure out why i'm getting a 401 (unauthorized) on my
queryUrl even with 'https://'.

I hardcoded the html and css first to build the struckture to match the mockup
I had planned to use that as my blueprint to convert it to dom manipulation. Trying
to solve these errors left me with no time to finish.

I would like to request a resubmit, please
